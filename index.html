			<h2>The experience</h2>
			<section>
				<p>
					Have you ever wanted to stare breathlessly at the golden sky on a plastic beach? Or perhaps swim with sea turtles in a tropical coral reef on a sunny day in Austrailia? You may not have money for a plane ticket, but with an internet connection, you can now take yourself anywhere in the world by tuning into our Vaporwave Radio.
				</p>
				<p>
					Vaporwave is a subgenre of electronic music which features heavy sampling and editing, surreal and futuristic themes, and 1980s and 1990s imagery, musical styles, and consumer culture.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is a Vaporwave channel to apeal to all audiences. It does not matter if you have an AARP discount or you are 9 years old.
				</p>
				<p>
					Vaporwave is best listened to when blasting down I-90 while breaking the land speed record for a 1997 Honda Civic. All while screaming at your younger brother because his Roblox game is to loud.
				</p>
				<p>
					We will now go on a Vaporwave journey so kick back get out the cheap koolaid and tell your mom to close the bedroom door because this is going to be a wild ride.
				</p>
				<p>
					The heart and soul is affected by listening to Vaporwave. God will smile upon you and all kidney failure suddenly be cured.
				</p>
				<p>
					Listening to Vaporwave stops racism, unless your listening to FashWave or Trumpwave, as these are subgenres of Vaporwave that emphize Nazi symbolism or Donald Trump.
